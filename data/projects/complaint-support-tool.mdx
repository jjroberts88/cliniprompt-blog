## Problem

Clinical complaints represent a significant source of stress and administrative burden for healthcare organizations:

- **High stress levels** for clinical staff dealing with complaint responses
- **Time-consuming process** to craft appropriate and comprehensive responses
- **Risk of escalation** when responses are inadequate or miss key points
- **Inconsistent quality** in complaint response letters across different staff members
- **Administrative burden** that takes clinicians away from patient care
- **Potential for further distress** to both staff and patients when complaints are poorly handled

## Overview

A comprehensive LLM-powered application designed to streamline the complaint response process for healthcare organizations. The system analyzes de-identified complaint letters and provides structured, evidence-based response templates with intelligent assistance for completion.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Automated complaint analysis** of uploaded de-identified letters
- **Structured response template generation** based on complaint content
- **LLM-assisted completion** with specialized system prompts
- **Quality assurance** through structured guidance for key response elements
- **Workflow management** for complaint tracking and resolution
- **De-identification compliance** for patient privacy protection

## Stack

**Backend:**

- Python for core application logic
- LangChain for multi-agent LLM orchestration
- Claude API for natural language processing
- FastAPI for REST API development
- PostgreSQL for data storage and complaint tracking

**Infrastructure:**

- Docker for containerization
- Microservices architecture
- Cloud-native deployment ready

## Status

**Current Phase:** Redesign and Development

The application has evolved through multiple iterations and is currently being redesigned to integrate with Claude's artifact system for enhanced user experience and response generation capabilities.

**Progress:**

- ‚úÖ Initial multi-agent LangChain architecture developed
- ‚úÖ Core complaint analysis functionality implemented
- ‚úÖ De-identification and privacy compliance established
- üîÑ Redesigning for Claude artifact system integration
- ‚è≥ Enhanced user interface development in progress
- ‚è≥ System prompt optimization ongoing
