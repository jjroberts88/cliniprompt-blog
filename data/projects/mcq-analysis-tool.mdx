## Problem

Medical schools had to adapt to a new system of national medical school examinations, creating challenges for student preparation:

- **New examination format** requiring updated study approaches
- **Lack of personalized feedback** on student performance weaknesses
- **Difficulty identifying knowledge gaps** from exam results
- **Generic revision materials** not tailored to individual student needs
- **Time-intensive manual analysis** of student performance patterns

## Overview

An intelligent exam analysis tool that processes medical student responses to multiple choice questions and generates personalized revision plans. The system uses LLM analysis to categorize questions by topic and subject area, then identifies knowledge gaps to create targeted study recommendations.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Automated question analysis** using LLM to categorize topics and subjects
- **Performance gap identification** through incorrect response analysis
- **Personalized revision plan generation** based on individual weaknesses
- **Cost-effective processing** using basic coding techniques for marking
- **Customizable study schedules** with adjustable timescales
- **Comprehensive subject area mapping** for medical curriculum alignment

## Stack

**Backend:**

- Python for core application logic and exam marking
- LLM integration for question analysis and categorization
- SQLite for question database and topic mapping
- Data processing libraries for performance analysis

## Status

**Current Phase:** Production Ready

The tool successfully analyzes student exam responses and generates personalized revision plans, optimizing costs through efficient processing techniques.
