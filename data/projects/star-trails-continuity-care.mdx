## Problem

Primary care faces significant challenges in maintaining continuity across complex and fragmented clinical records:

- **Fragmented patient records** across multiple systems and encounters
- **Difficulty creating clear overviews** of patient health journeys
- **Complex investigation tracking** across multiple timepoints
- **Intervention relationship mapping** challenges
- **Time-intensive manual review** of patient histories
- **Lost context** between different clinical encounters

## Overview

An innovative knowledge graph-based system designed to improve continuity of care by creating comprehensive, interpretable patient health journeys. The system combines Neo4j graph databases with LLM agents to automatically generate and interpret patient care visualizations.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Knowledge graph generation** for patient presentations
- **Comprehensive data integration** including encounters, investigations, and interventions
- **Relationship mapping** between clinical data points
- **LLM-powered interpretation** of patient care patterns
- **Automated summaries** and clinical insights
- **Interactive care journey visualization**

## Stack

**Backend:**

- Python for core application logic
- Neo4j for graph database and knowledge representation
- LLM agents for graph interpretation and analysis
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless integration

**Infrastructure:**

- Graph database architecture
- Real-time data processing
- Clinical data integration pipelines

## Status

**Current Phase:** Early Development

The project is in active development with focus on Neo4j certification completion and prototype framework development.

**Progress:**

- üîÑ Neo4j certification in progress
- üîÑ Early prototype framework development
- ‚è≥ MCP integration planning
- ‚è≥ Clinical data modeling design
- ‚è≥ LLM agent architecture planning

**Future Vision:**

- **Seamless EHR integration** for real-time patient data
- **Predictive care insights** based on historical patterns
- **Clinical decision support** through graph analysis
- **Multi-provider care coordination** tools
